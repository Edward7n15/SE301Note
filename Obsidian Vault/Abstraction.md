Model something in real-world. Pack data into an instance as attributes. 

<a>Selective ignorance</a> : It sorts complex data, so you can fetch the details you need directly and ignore anything else.

It connects the real world to programs. 

# In Java

## Object:
- An entity with specific <a> attribute values</a> (state), <a>behavior, and identity</a>
- typically <a>instantiated</a> from a class

## Class:
- associated type of an object
- defines attributes and methods

	We assign "the shape" of a class to an object.
	Class is the model, and Object is the actual product.
