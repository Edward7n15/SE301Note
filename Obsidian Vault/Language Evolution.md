COBOL, Fortran: break up system into subroutines, different subprograms <a>share the same memory</a> to fetch data. (global data)

Algol, Pascal: nested procedures with <a>block structured scope</a>. (Encapsulation)

Modula-2, C: modules (files) of related data and functions. It breaks up system into moduels, each modules can <a>only access its own data scope</a>. (abstract data types)
	Normally, it only have one database as a whole.

Smalltalk, C++, Java: calsses with data and methods. Classes as "factories" for objects. It breaks up system into <a>classes</a>.
	Each class have its own database with objects as instances. <a>Objects encapsulate data</a>.

SE design principle: **divide and conquer.
